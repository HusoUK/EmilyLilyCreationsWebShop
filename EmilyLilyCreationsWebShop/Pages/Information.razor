                    <p>I have always had a passion for crafting and jewelery, so I have finally cobined the two things.</p>
                    <p>My polymer clay journey started by making a few odd pairs of earrings for myself and after several attempts and lots of learning I finally made some earrings I was happy with for personal use.</p>
                    <p>As a little bit of a perfectionist I was not happy leaving things there and continued to work on my crafting, technique and designs. Friends and family soon started making there orders and requests.</p>
                    <p>So I decide to turn my passion into a little business.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What are cookies:</strong></p>
                    <p>We and our business partners collect information about your use of our website through cookies. Cookies are information files stored on your computer, tablet or smartphone that help websites remember who you are and information about your visit. Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies.</p>
                    <p><strong>What cookies are used on this Website:</strong></p>
                    <p>The cookies we and our business partners use on this website are broadly grouped into the following categories:</p>
                    <p><strong>Essential</strong> – Some of the cookies on our website are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this would be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on the website or which allows communication between your browser and the website. Our cookie preference cookie described in the section “How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?” is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our website without these cookies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analytics</strong> – We use analytics cookies to helps us understand how users engage with our website. An example is counting the number of different people coming to our website or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited the website once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We would find it difficult to analyse how well our website was performing and improve it without these cookies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social Sharing</strong> – We use cookies to allow you to share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about a business or product advertised on our website.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> – You will have noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. We, like many businesses may place adverts for ourselves on a range of associated websites. However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you we use cookies to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and the geography that you are based in. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant.</p>
                    <p><strong>How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?</strong></p>
